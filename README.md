# Snek - A simple dummy Snake

Just a little snake game made in C++ with SFML in a couple of hours, just to see if I wasn't rusted using this awesome library.

This snake have :
- A score system
- Fruits (red) to grow (add +2 to score multiplier)
- Shrinker (blue) to shrink (remove 1 to score multiplier)
- A head (yellow)
- No boundaries
- A speed that increase with size

Close when loose. No win condition. A yes you could technically score to integer limit using a small snake and the fact that there is no boundaries.

Created with Visual Studio 2022. Should compile.
